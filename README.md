# DS-5220-SML-Project

1) Designed a CNN-based classifier to predict Alzheimer's and distinguish between current stages of dementia. <br><br>
2) Used feature selection to extract texture and shape aspects of the Hippocampus region from MRI scan. <br> <br>
3) Analyzed and compared performances of SOTA models for the detection of various stages of Alzheimer's. <br> <br>
4) Achieved an average testing accuracy of 93% with a CNN-based classifier after the introduction of additional dropout layers along with categorical cross entropy as a    loss function.
